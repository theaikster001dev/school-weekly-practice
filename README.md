# School Weekly Practice

## JavaScript Practice
This material should be completed with a text editor and then tested in a web browser console. Aiken will save his text editor file(s) to his school-weekly-practice GitHub folder.

Chapters 1 - 2 are purely theory. Chapters 3 and 4 have guided challenges to complete.

Follow the order beginning with:
"1a Instructions (Begin Here) 1a JS API pages 1 - 12 Introduction"

and see the accompanying theory for further explanations: 
"1a Theory JS API pages 1 - 12 Introduction"

### Instructions to begin on Friday July 25:
Start with the file: 1a Instructions (Begin Here) 1a JS API pages 1 - 12 Introduction

You need a simple text editor (e.g. the one that comes with Windows) to write and save the code you write (download Notepad++ if you want a more programming like editor https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/).

To test the code you've written you paste what you've written in a web-browser console. Visit about:blank in a web browser (where we usually put www.website.com, instead place about:blank here) and then press F12 (Firefox/Chrome) to access the console.

So in the instructions files, you will see a program explained like this:

"When you enter code at the cursor and press enter, JavaScript should run, or execute, your code and display the result (if any) on the next line. For example, type this into the console:

3 + 4;

Now press enter. JavaScript should output the answer (7) to this simple bit of addition on the following line:

3 + 4; 
7"

You should write your program down in the text editor--in this case, 3 + 4; -- and save your text file in the GitHub folder "school-weekly-practice" for me to view your program.

Guided challenges begin at the end of chapter 3 where we learn abut arrays and will be included in the instructions file.

## Supplementary Material
This material is designed to complement the weekly lessons. If Aiken completes the weekly tasks, he should explore the resources provided in the links below or retrieve additional projects from the supplemental work folder.
